# 3D CSS SLIDES
A little Three.js experiment I made some years ago trying to combine WebGL and CSS3D together to create HTML interactive 3D slide presentations in a customized WebGL background.
The final result was nice, but not as fast as expected.

## What do we learned?
* Combining two different 3D render techniques (using an alpha channel) is possible and gives nice results,
despite not being an optimal solution.
* CSS3D could be a bit slow if you try to open lots of iframes with lot of javascript and resources each one (slide reflections are also iframes).
